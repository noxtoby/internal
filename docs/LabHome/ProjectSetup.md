# POND Project Setup Guide

We recommend for each project at POND to have several key elements to facilitate collaboration and ensure reproducbility.  For clarity in naming, all elements should be named similarly -- often ```Lastname_ProjectName``` with CamelCasing, where "Lastname" is the last name of the first author leading the project.


### GitHub repository

All code, from the beginning of the project, should be in a github repository.  This is a prerequisite for reproducible science -- please start your project out on the right foot! We encourage these repos to reside in [UCL-POND](www.github.com/ucl-pond), rather than in your personal GitHub account.


### GitHub pages wiki

Careful tracking of your project is beneficial. Best practices like well-commented code, reproducible analytic notebooks, and a well-maintained trello board are very helpful, an "overview" wiki also helps a lot to document how the different pieces of code fit together. This can be  easily made using markdown and github pages (like this one), see the [project docs page](/docs/Contributing/project-documentation/). Note that this wiki is what your replication buddy (if assigned) will use for replicating your code; see the [project reproducability guide](/docs/LabHome/ReproSystem/).


### Other channels

Sharing knowledge helps everyone, including yourself. Should there be sufficient interest, we can setup a POND Slack channel and/or Trello board.

#### Shared folders

UCL uses a Microsoft ecosystem, so OneDrive/SharePoint is the preferred method of data/file sharing.

#### Zotero library

Right at the start of a project, when people on the team start sending you relevant papers, download [Zotero](https://zotero.org) and create a reference library for the project.

#### Project folder

While some projects can be done locally on your laptop, many require more computing resources.  In general, ask your PI whether you should setup a project folder on the [CS cluster](/docs/cluster).
