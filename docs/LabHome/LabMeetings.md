# POND Meetings

Lab meetings usually occur every Tuesday 1400â€“1500, with breaks for holidays and summer.

The standard agenda is flexible, but normally consists of scheduled research updates and any other business (AOB). The current meeting schedule can be found [here](/post/meeting_schedule).

Team members line managed by a POND PI are expected to attend POND meetings (and to send apologies if not attending). Colleagues from CMIC/AIC/DRC/etc. are welcome to attend, subject to space limitations.

### Guest Speakers

If you have ideas for guest speakers to invite, please propose them as AOB at a POND meeting and we'll go from there.

### Research Updates

Each lab member presents their current project in an accessible scientific format, with a **focus** on explaining new methods, exciting results, and current obstacles, and the **goal** of obtaining constructive feedback.

This is an informal format where questions, discussion, and interruptions are _highly_ encouraged. 

(Please swap well in advance if you're not ready to present either your work in progress, or a journal club.)

### Journal Club

We encourage you to join a CMIC Interest Group and/or the DRC Journal Club (as relevant), but we can accommodate POND-specific journal clubs on an _ad hoc_ basis, according to need.


### TBC: Quarterly update

This is to be discussed. An idea from PennLINC that sounds good.

This is a format to allow everyone in the lab to keep track of ongoing projects, and encourage collaboration. It occurs 1x a quarter.  This is an opportunity for us all to stay on the same page regarding what projects are going on in the lab. Each lab member has about ~3 minutes to present a single slide describing what they have been most focussed on in the past month. If you are managing several projects, choose one to focus on (but it is ok to allude briefly to the others). Given the fact that there always are a wide range of experience levels in the lab, it should be emphasised that the most important goal of this update is that it is _accessible_, and folks can grasp "the big picture".

The quarterly update may be more likely to be accessible if the following elements are covered.

1. Study hypothesis: What is the over-arching hypothesis of the research? If currently at an early study phase, would use grant aims that are most applicable to the current phase.

2. Dataset: including study (ADNI, PPMI, TrackHD, OASIS, UKB, HCP, etc), modality (T1, DTI, x-PET, etc.), and feature type (cortical thickness, FA, etc.).

2. Study stage: be explict about where you are in a project.  Stages of a project are outlined in the [Stages of a Project Wiki](//docs/LabHome/ProjectStages/).

3. Current progress:  This should be the meat of the update.  Place current work in the context of study phase and hypotheses.  Emphasize progress, but also challenges / obstacles so we can rapidly problem solve as a group. Again, focus on making the challenges and results accessible to lab members of all backgrounds.

4. Reproducibility: Who is your "buddy" for this project, and how will reproducibility be ensured?  Be explicit regarding where you are in terms of project reproducibility checkpoints outlined in the [Reproducibility Guide](//docs/LabHome/ReproSystem/).
