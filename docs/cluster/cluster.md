The CMIC/CS cluster is a very powerful set of servers for computing. As POND is in a computer science department, we expect a basic level of competence in HPC skills (linux, scripting, etc.). Having said that, this page is intended to contain any POND-specific details useful for the CS cluster.

## Additional information

[This page](https://hpc.cs.ucl.ac.uk) has key information about using the CS cluster.
